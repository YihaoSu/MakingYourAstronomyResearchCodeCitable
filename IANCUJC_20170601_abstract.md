# Making Your Astronomy Research Code Citable

## Abstract
In the spirit of reproducible research and improving research software credit, the American Astronomical Society Journals recently have adopted a policy that provides guidelines for citing software in papers. In this talk, I will walk you through the AAS Policy Statement on Software with several citable source code examples, providing you practical ways of how to license your astronomy research source code and make it citable.
